📊 NYC Airbnb Listings 2024: EDA Project Overview

✨ Objective

To explore New York City Airbnb data using EDA techniques to uncover patterns in pricing, availability, reviews, and host behavior.

⸻

📂 Dataset
	•	20,765 listings across NYC’s five boroughs.
	•	22 features including price, room type, availability, reviews, and geolocation.

⸻

⚙️ Workflow

✅ 1. Data Cleaning
	•	Handled missing data in price, neighbourhood, beds.
	•	Converted last_review to datetime.
	•	Capped outliers for prices above $1,000.

✅ 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
	•	Distribution: Plotted histograms to show price and availability trends.
	•	Correlations: Heatmap revealed weak correlation between price and reviews, but stronger trends with availability and room type.
	•	Neighborhoods: Bar charts showed Manhattan has the highest prices; Brooklyn is next.
	•	Room Types: Entire home/apartments dominate listings, but private rooms are popular budget options.
	•	Reviews: Pairplots and scatter plots showed listings with more availability tend to get more reviews.

✅ 3. Visualization Highlights
	•	📌 Heatmaps: For numerical correlations.
	•	📌 Pairplots: To check variable relationships.
	•	📌 Scatterplots & Maps: Visualized geographic distribution and room type clusters.
	•	📌 Barplots: Compared price dependencies across boroughs and room types.
